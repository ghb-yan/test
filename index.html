            <h2>Welcome to the Memory Test Game!</h2>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Each level presents a number for you to memorize within a 5-second time limit. Once the time is up, you will be prompted to enter the number you just saw. The numbers start from a single digit and increase in length as you progress through the levels.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Scoring System</h2>
            <p>Your score is calculated based on the number of levels you complete correctly. Each level has a different point value, starting from 5 points for the first level and increasing by 5 points for each subsequent level (e.g., Level 1 = 5 points, Level 2 = 10 points, Level 20 = 100 points). The maximum possible score is 1050 points.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Levels and Progress</h2>
            <p>The game consists of 20 levels. A progress bar at the top of the game screen shows your progress through the levels. Each completed level is marked with a green circle, while incorrect answers are marked with a red circle.</p>
